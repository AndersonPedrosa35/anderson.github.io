Every day he demonstrated not only that he had extensive knowledge of the languages we were using, but also that he was eager to meet the requirements and persistent in the face of difficulties. I can safely say that without his help the project wouldn't have turned out as well as it did. "</p>

He was always helpful and his ability to quickly read his colleague's reasoning/code made it easy to solve any bugs. "</p>
